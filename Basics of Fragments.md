Answer: replace can be used to replace Fragments while retaining shared elements and ensuring a smooth transition.

5. How can you customize the enter and exit transitions for a Fragment?

Answer: Override the onCreateAnimation method in the Fragment and return a custom animation.

Fragment and ViewModel:
What is the role of ViewModel in the context of Fragments?
Answer: ViewModel helps store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way, surviving configuration changes.

2. How can you share data between Fragments using a shared ViewModel?

Answer: Create a shared ViewModel and access it from both Fragments, observing data changes.

3.Explain the concept of ViewModel scope in a Fragment.

Answer: The ViewModel is scoped to the Fragment's lifecycle, ensuring that it is only retained as long as the Fragment is alive.

4. What is the purpose of by viewModels() delegate in a Fragment?

Answer: It is a property delegate that creates a ViewModel tied to the Fragment's lifecycle.

5. How can you handle communication between Fragments using ViewModel and LiveData?

Answer: Use a shared ViewModel with a LiveData object to observe changes in one Fragment triggered by another.

Fragment Testing:
Explain the role of FragmentScenario in testing Fragments.
Answer: FragmentScenario is a part of the AndroidX Test library, providing a framework for testing Fragments in isolation.
