What are Android Architecture Components? Android Architecture

Answer: Components are a collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps. They provide a clear and idiomatic way to consume REST APIs. These components include Room, ViewModel, LiveData, and others.

2. What is LiveData?

Answer: LiveData is an observable data holder class that is lifecycle-aware. This means it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services, and only updates app component observers that are in an active lifecycle state.

3. What is ViewModel?

Answer:The ViewModel class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way. The ViewModel class allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.

4. What is Room?

Answer: Room is a persistence library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite. It allows for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.

5. How does LiveData work with ViewModel?

Answer: LiveData can be used in conjunction with ViewModel to update the UI automatically when the data changes. ViewModel holds the LiveData objects, and the UI components observe these objects.

6. What are the benefits of using Android Architecture Components? Answer: Android Architecture Components can help to construct a robust app architecture, simplify the handling of data changes, and ensure that the UI matches the current state of data.

7. What is the purpose of the onCleared() method in ViewModel?

Answer:The onCleared() method in ViewModel is called when the ViewModel is no longer used and will be destroyed. This method is useful to clean up any resources that the ViewModel might be using.

8. What is the difference between LiveData and MutableLiveData?

Answer: LiveData is an observable data holder class, while MutableLiveData is a LiveData class that exposes the setValue(T) and postValue(T) methods publicly. You can use MutableLiveData when you need to change the stored data.

9. What is the advantage of using Room over raw SQLite?

Answer:Room provides an abstraction layer over SQLite, making it easier and more intuitive to work with databases in Android. It includes compile-time checks of SQL queries, reducing the likelihood of runtime SQL errors.

10. What is the role of the Repository in Android Architecture Components?

Answer:The Repository is a design pattern that mediates between different data sources, such as persistent models, web services, and caches. In the context of Android Architecture Components, a Repository manages query threads and allows you to use multiple backends.

11. What is Data Binding and how is it useful in Android Architecture Components?

Answer:Data Binding is a support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically. This reduces boilerplate code and prevents common programming errors.

12. What is the lifecycle of a ViewModel?

Answer:The lifecycle of a ViewModel extends from when you first request a ViewModel until the associated UI controller (activity or fragment) is finished completely and is in the destroyed state.

13. What is the difference between setValue() and postValue() in LiveData?

Answer:setValue(T) method must be called from the main thread. If the code is invoked from a worker thread, you can use postValue(T) method instead which posts a task to a main thread to set the given value.

14.How does Room handle object relationships?

Answer:Room allows you to define Foreign Key relationships between your entities. This ensures integrity at the database level by declaring relationships between tables.

15.What is a TypeConverter in Room?

Answer:Room provides functionality to convert between primitive and boxed types but doesn’t allow for object references between entities. This is where TypeConverter comes in. It allows you to convert custom classes to known types that Room can persist.

16.What is the role of LiveData in MVVM architecture?

Answer: In MVVM architecture, LiveData allows data changes in the Model layer to be observed in the ViewModel and then automatically reflected in the View layer.

17. What is the difference between ViewModel and AndroidViewModel? Answer: AndroidViewModel is a subclass of ViewModel that includes an Application reference. This is useful if, for example, you need a context to access SharedPreferences or other Android components.

18.How does Room support LiveData?

Answer: Room provides built-in support for LiveData. Your DAO methods can return a LiveData object, and Room generates all necessary code to update the LiveData object when the database is updated.

19. What is a LiveData Transformations?

Answer:Transformations are a set of utility methods that can be used to manipulate LiveData objects. For example, Transformations.map() applies a function to the output of LiveData and propagates the result downstream.

20.What is the benefit of using a Repository in Android Architecture Components?

Answer:A Repository class abstracts access to multiple data sources. It handles data operations and allows you to use multiple backends such as network, cache, and database. This provides a clean API to the rest of the app and helps to achieve separation of concerns.

21.What is the role of Entity in Room?

Answer:An Entity represents a table within the database. Room creates a table for each class that has @Entity annotations, the fields in the class correspond to columns in the table.

22.What is a DAO in Room?

Answer:DAO stands for Data Access Object. It’s an interface that defines the methods for accessing the database. In Room, you annotate a DAO interface or abstract class with @Dao.

23.What is a Database class in Room?

Answer:The Database class is a holder class that uses annotations to define the list of entities and database version. This class content defines the list of tables and version within the database.

24. What is the difference between allowMainThreadQueries() and fallbackToDestructiveMigration() in Room?

Answer:allowMainThreadQueries() allows Room to execute database operations on the main thread, which is not recommended because it can lock the UI. fallbackToDestructiveMigration() allows Room to recreate database tables if their schemas have changed.

25.What is the role of Paging Library in Android Architecture Components?

Answer:The Paging Library helps you load and display small chunks of data at a time. It is useful for when you’re working with large data sets that can affect the performance of your app.

26.What is WorkManager in Android Architecture Components? Answer:WorkManager is a library used for background work that defers tasks or runs them synchronously. It respects the lifecycle and state of your app and has a flexible retry policy.
